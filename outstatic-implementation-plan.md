# Outstatic Integration Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines our plan to integrate Outstatic CMS with our Next.js project. We will follow a step-by-step approach, testing each phase before moving to the next.

## Current Status (May 8, 2025)
- Completed Phase 1: Setup and Initial Configuration
- Completed Phase 2: Outstatic File Structure
- Completed Phase 3: Article Collection Implementation
- Currently at Phase 4: Article Functionality

## Next Immediate Steps
1. **Troubleshoot Errors**: Address the errors encountered during Outstatic setup
2. Implement Article Index Page
3. Implement Article Detail Page

## Project Requirements
- Homepage
- Article section (formerly blog)
- Case studies section
- One additional page
- Simple, maintainable content management

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Setup and Initial Configuration
1. **Create a feature branch**
   - Create `feature/outstatic-integration` branch from `main`
   - Push branch to remote

2. **Install Outstatic**
   - Run `npm install outstatic`
   - Verify package is added to package.json

3. **Setup GitHub OAuth Application**
   - Create GitHub OAuth App
   - Add OAuth credentials to environment variables
   - Test GitHub authentication is working

4. **Environment Variables Management**
   - Create `.env.local` file for development
   - Add GitHub OAuth credentials to `.env.local`
   - Document required environment variables for production
   - Ensure environment variables are properly loaded in the app

### Phase 2: Outstatic File Structure
4. **Create CMS route group**
   - Add `(cms)` route group in app directory
   - Create layout.tsx for the CMS area
   - Test route group isolation works

5. **Setup Outstatic Dashboard**
   - Create `outstatic/[[...ost]]/page.tsx` in the CMS route group
   - Implement the Outstatic component
   - Test dashboard renders properly

6. **Configure API Routes**
   - Create API route at `app/api/outstatic/[[...ost]]/route.ts`
   - Implement OutstaticApi handlers
   - Test API endpoints respond correctly

### Phase 3: Article Collection Implementation
7. **Define Article Collection**
   - Create Article collection in Outstatic
   - Configure custom fields for articles with:
     - Title
     - Publication date
     - Featured image
     - Content
     - Excerpt
     - Tags
   - Test collection is created properly

8. **Create Sample Article Content**
   - Create several sample articles
   - Test content is saved as markdown files
   - Verify GitHub storage is working correctly

### Phase 4: Article Functionality
9. **Implement Article Data Fetching**
   - Use Outstatic's built-in functions instead of custom utility functions:
     - `getDocuments` for fetching multiple articles
     - `getDocumentBySlug` for fetching single articles
     - `getDocumentSlugs` for generating static paths
   - Implementation research findings:
     - Outstatic handles sorting by date automatically
     - No need for separate utility file - use functions directly in components

10. **Create Article Pages**
    - Create article listing page with card grid layout at `/src/app/article/page.tsx`
    - Create individual article template at `/src/app/article/[slug]/page.tsx`
    - Implement article navigation
    - Test article content display and routing

11. **Implement SEO Best Practices**
    - Add proper meta tags (title, description) to article pages
    - Implement Open Graph and Twitter card meta tags
    - Add structured data for articles (Schema.org)
    - Create canonical URLs
    - Implement proper heading hierarchy

### Phase 5: Homepage Integration
12. **Update Static Homepage**
    - Optionally add latest articles to homepage
    - Create navigation to article section
    - Keep homepage content static (not managed by Outstatic)
    - Test homepage to article navigation

### Phase 6: Additional Collections (After Article Section is Working)
13. **Implement Case Studies Collection**
    - Create Case Studies collection
    - Configure custom fields for case studies
    - Create sample case studies
    - Implement case studies listing and detail pages
    - Test case studies functionality

14. **Implement Pages Collection (if needed)**
    - Create Pages collection
    - Configure custom fields for pages
    - Create additional pages as needed
    - Test additional pages

### Phase 7: Styling and Refinement
15. **Apply Styling**
    - Style article section first
    - Style homepage integration points
    - Style any additional collections implemented
    - Test responsive design

16. **Optimize Performance**
    - Implement image optimization
    - Test performance metrics

17. **Additional SEO Enhancements**
    - Create a sitemap
    - Implement XML feed if needed
    - Add meta robots tags where appropriate
    - Create breadcrumb navigation

### Phase 8: Testing and Deployment
18. **Comprehensive Testing**
    - Test all implemented functionality
    - Validate SEO implementations
    - Test on multiple devices and browsers
    - Fix any issues

19. **Merge and Deploy**
    - Create PR for `feature/outstatic-integration`
    - Review code
    - Merge to `main`
    - Deploy to production
    - Configure production environment variables

## Git Workflow
Following our established Git workflow:
1. Always branch from latest `main`
2. Use descriptive branch names with `feature/` prefix
3. Commit frequently with clear messages
4. Push regularly to remote
5. Create PR for review when complete
6. Delete branch after merging

## Testing Checkpoints
After each step, we will:
1. Verify functionality works as expected
2. Check for any errors or warnings
3. Confirm changes don't break existing code
4. Only proceed to next step after successful testing

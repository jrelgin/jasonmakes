    - Style homepage integration points
    - Style any additional collections implemented
    - Test responsive design

15. **Optimize Performance**
    - Implement image optimization
    - Test performance metrics

16. **SEO Implementation**
    - Add proper metadata to blog pages
    - Implement structured data for blog posts
    - Create a sitemap
    - Ensure proper handling of canonical URLs
    - Implement OpenGraph and Twitter card metadata

### Phase 8: Testing and Deployment
17. **Comprehensive Testing**

    - Validate SEO implementations
    - Test on multiple devices and browsers
    - Fix any issues

18. **Merge and Deploy**
    - Create PR for `feature/outstatic-integration`
    - Review code
    - Merge to `main`
    - Deploy to production
    - Configure production environment variables

## Git Workflow
Following our established Git workflow:
1. Always branch from latest `main`
2. Use descriptive branch names with `feature/` prefix
3. Commit frequently with clear messages
4. Push regularly to remote
5. Create PR for review when complete
6. Delete branch after merging

## Testing Checkpoints
After each step, we will:
1. Verify functionality works as expected
2. Check for any errors or warnings
3. Confirm changes don't break existing code
4. Only proceed to next step after successful testing

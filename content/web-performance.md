# Web Performance Optimization Techniques

Website performance directly impacts user experience, conversion rates, and even SEO rankings. Here are some essential techniques to ensure your sites are fast and responsive.

## Core Web Vitals and Why They Matter

Google's Core Web Vitals have become the industry standard for measuring user experience:

- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: Measures loading performance
- **First Input Delay (FID)**: Measures interactivity
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: Measures visual stability

Optimizing for these metrics not only improves SEO but creates genuinely better user experiences.

## Image Optimization Strategies

Images often account for the largest portion of page weight. Optimize them by:

- Using modern formats like WebP and AVIF
- Implementing responsive images with srcset
- Lazy loading images below the fold
- Using appropriate compression levels

## JavaScript Performance

JavaScript can significantly impact site performance:

- Minimize and defer non-critical JavaScript
- Use code splitting to load only what's needed
- Consider modern approaches like Islands Architecture
- Profile performance regularly to identify bottlenecks

## CSS Optimization

Efficient CSS can dramatically improve rendering performance:

- Remove unused CSS
- Consider critical CSS approaches
- Use CSS containment where appropriate
- Minimize render-blocking stylesheets

## Serverless and Edge Computing

Moving computation closer to users can significantly reduce latency:

- Deploy static assets to CDNs
- Use edge functions for dynamic content
- Implement stale-while-revalidate patterns
- Consider incremental static regeneration for dynamic content

Performance optimization is an ongoing process rather than a one-time task. Regular testing and monitoring using tools like Lighthouse, WebPageTest, and real user monitoring (RUM) will help ensure your site remains fast as it evolves.

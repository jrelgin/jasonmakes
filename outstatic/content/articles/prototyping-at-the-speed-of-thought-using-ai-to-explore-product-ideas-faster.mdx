In the early stages of product design, speed and exploration are everything. But too often, we get bogged down in tooling, stakeholder expectations, or the trap of perfect fidelity. AI has opened up a new lane—one where designers can prototype ideas not just faster, but *smarter*.

Whether you’re building flows with AI-assisted Figma plugins, generating starter code from natural language, or simulating user feedback through LLMs, AI allows product teams to experiment and iterate in ways that weren’t possible even a year ago.

## Why AI Prototyping Matters

Prototypes aren't about polish—they're about potential. The faster we can surface an idea, get it in front of collaborators, and gather feedback, the better decisions we can make. With tools like GPT-4, Midjourney, and tools like Galileo AI or Uizard, designers can now:

- Turn a napkin sketch into a working UI in minutes
- Generate user flows and test edge cases
- Draft UX copy that aligns with tone and intent
- Simulate onboarding or first-use journeys for different personas

All without writing a single line of code—or bugging your dev team.

## A Real Example

Last week, I used an LLM prompt to generate three alternate onboarding flows for a feature idea. Within ten minutes, I had clickable prototypes in Figma, along with suggested microcopy and rough performance metrics. One of those prototypes led to a conversation with the PM that changed the scope of the MVP.

The takeaway? AI didn’t replace design work—it *accelerated* our ability to frame the problem and align around it.

## Where to Start

If you're curious, here’s a simple challenge to try:

1. Take one feature idea you’ve been kicking around.
2. Use an LLM to generate a basic user flow or wireframe description.
3. Feed it into your favorite prototyping tool—Galileo, Uizard, Figma+ChatGPT plugin, etc.
4. Share with a peer and get feedback.

The point isn’t perfection—it’s momentum.
